    <div id = title2>Academics, Work, and a little about me</div>
    <p> I was born and raised in Astoria New York, I am a senior currently majoring in Information Technology with a focus in CyberSecurity. I plan on graduating in May of 2018.
    I am currently involved with no clubs or organizations at Pace. The reason behind this is I work a full time job at FreshDirect working as an Operation Analyst.
    Here I spend my time working on various in-house projects or support for the company. Recently we updated our phone system from Avaya to Cisco and I had to learn a new system to teach to the other technicians and end users.
	Switching topics a bit  besides technology the thing I love most are my two dogs. One is a puggle and the other is a rottweiler. I dont really have pictures of them but if you dont know what a puggle looks like here it is. <br> <center>

    <div id = title2>Why am I taking this course?</div>
    <p> The reason why I decided to take this course is so I can learn more about web development besides just HTML,JavaScript, and CSS.
    I wanna see what a webpage pushed to its limits can really look like. I have been interested in CIT101 since I took it with Professor Nomee and was excited to take this class as an open elective once I saw it open. What I hope to learn is exactly that. Figuring out how to make a website look as cool and do as much as possible.

    <div id = title2>The future and experiences.</div>
    Im getting a focus in cybersecurity but the more I do other things the more I realize I like those things rather than cybersecurity. At work I am currently working with a sharepoint Admin on fixing office 365 and making applications for sharepoint and it seems really fun. I might make a bot or two for Microsoft Teams and or Slack. But I want to work with Sharepoint or an Intranet developing a companies interior more. That seems like fun
    For experience, I created a front end for a database for my internship last summer, I took the CIT course for web development, and won the Hack-a-thon I think now two years or maybe one year ago with fellow classmate Eric Azzopardi
